    "readme": "# @carbon/icons-react\n\n> React components for icons in digital and software products using the Carbon\n> Design System\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo install `@carbon/icons-react` in your project, you will need to run the\nfollowing command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```bash\nnpm install -S @carbon/icons-react\n```\n\nIf you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command\ninstead:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @carbon/icons-react\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can import an icon component intoo your project by referring to its name:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n```\n\nEach icon supports a `size` prop and supports the 16px, 20px, 24px, and 32px\nsizes by default. The default size for each icon is 16px.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction ExampleComponent() {\n  return <Add size={32} />;\n}\n```\n\nWe also provide CommonJS and UMD files in the `lib` and `umd` directories,\nrespectively.\n\nTo import using CommonJS, you can do the following:\n\n```js\nconst { Add } = require('@carbon/icons-react');\n```\n\n_Note: if you would like to find the import path for an icon, you can reference\nour\n[Icon Library](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/iconography/library)_\n\n### Icon fill\n\nAll icons from the library support being styled by the `fill` property. You can\nchange the color of an icon by passing in a custom class name that sets this\nproperty (preferred), or by passing in an inline style. For example:\n\n```css\n// CSS custom class name to set the fill of the icon to `rebeccapurple`\nsvg.my-custom-class {\n  fill: rebeccapurple;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <Add aria-label=\"Add\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Two-tone icons\n\nCertain icons in the library support two distinct fill colors. You can target\nthe inner path by using the `[data-icon-path=\"inner-path\"]` attribute selector.\nFor example:\n\n```scss\n// CSS custom class name to set the fill of the icon to `yellow`\nsvg.my-custom-class {\n  fill: yellow;\n}\n\n// Use the `data-icon-path` attribute selector to target the inner path\n// where we want to set the fill to `black`. We also set `opacity` to `1` so\n// that this inner-path is visible.\nsvg.my-custom-class [data-icon-path='inner-path'] {\n  fill: black;\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { WarningFilled } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return <WarningFilled aria-label=\"Add\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />;\n}\n```\n\n### Focus and `aria-label`\n\nBy default, the icon components from `@carbon/icons-react` are treated as\ndecorative content. This means that we set `aria-hidden=\"true\"` unless certain\nprops are passed to the component.\n\nIf you would like the icon to be announced by a screen reader, you can supply an\n`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <Add aria-label=\"Add\" />\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDoing this will add the appropriate `role` to the `<svg>` node, as well.\n\nIf you would like the `<svg>` to receive focus, you will need to pass in a\n`tabIndex` value. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return <Add aria-label=\"Add\" tabIndex=\"0\" />;\n}\n```\n\nIncluding `tabIndex` and `aria-label` (or `aria-labelledby`) will set the\ncorresponding `tabindex` on the underlying `<svg>` and verify support in older\nbrowsers like Internet Explorer 11 by setting `focusable` to `true`.\n\n## üôå Contributing\n\nWe're always looking for contributors to help us fix bugs, build new features,\nor help us improve the project documentation.
