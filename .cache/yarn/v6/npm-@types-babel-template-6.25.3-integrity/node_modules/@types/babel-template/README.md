type Node = t.Node;

// NB: This export doesn't match the handbook example, where `template` is the default export.
// But it does match the runtime behaviour (at least at the time of this writing). For some reason,
// babel-template/lib/index.js has this line at the bottom: module.exports = exports["default"];
export = template;
declare function template(code: string, opts?: BabylonOptions): UseTemplate;

type UseTemplate = (nodes?: { [placeholder: string]: Node }) => Node;
