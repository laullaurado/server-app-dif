Very quick general-purpose deep\ncomparison, too. Great for `React.memo` and `shouldComponentUpdate`.\n\nThis is a fork of the brilliant\n[fast-deep-equal](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal) with some\nextra handling for React.\n\n![benchmark chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/master/assets/benchmarking.png \"benchmarking chart\")\n\n(Check out the [benchmarking details](#benchmarking-this-library).)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add react-fast-compare\n# or\n$ npm install react-fast-compare\n```\n\n## Highlights\n\n- ES5 compatible; works in node.js (0.10+) and browsers (IE9+)\n- deeply compares any value (besides objects with circular references)\n- handles React-specific circular references, like elements\n- checks equality Date and RegExp objects\n- should as fast as [fast-deep-equal](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal) via a single unified library, and with added guardrails for circular references.\n- small: under 660 bytes minified+gzipped\n\n## Usage\n\n```jsx\nconst isEqual = require(\"react-fast-compare\");\n\n// general usage\nconsole.log(isEqual({ foo: \"bar\" }, { foo: \"bar\" })); // true\n\n// React.memo\n// only re-render ExpensiveComponent when the props have deeply changed\nconst DeepMemoComponent = React.memo(ExpensiveComponent, isEqual);\n\n// React.Component shouldComponentUpdate\n// only re-render AnotherExpensiveComponent when the props have deeply changed\nclass AnotherExpensiveComponent extends React.Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n    return !isEqual(this.props, nextProps);\n  }\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Do I Need `React.memo` (or `shouldComponentUpdate`)?\n\n> What's faster than a really fast deep comparison? No deep comparison at all.\n\n—This Readme\n\nDeep checks in `React.memo` or a `shouldComponentUpdate` should not be used blindly.\nFirst, see if the default\n[React.memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) or\n[PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent)\nwill work for you. If it won't (if you need deep checks), it's wise to make\nsure you've correctly indentified the bottleneck in your application by\n[profiling the performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab).\nAfter you've determined that you _do_ need deep equality checks and you've\nidentified the minimum number of places to apply them, then this library may\nbe for you!\n\n## Benchmarking this Library\n\nThe absolute values are much less important than the relative differences\nbetween packages.\n\nBenchmarking source can be found\n[here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/blob/master/benchmark/index.js).\nEach \"operation\" consists of running all relevant tests. The React benchmark\nuses both the generic tests and the react tests; these runs will be slower\nsimply because there are more tests in each operation.\n\nThe results below are from a local test on a laptop _(stats last updated 6/2/2020)_:\n\n### Generic Data\n\n```\nreact-fast-compare x 177,600 ops/sec ±1.73% (92 runs sampled)\nfast-deep-equal x 184,211 ops/sec ±0.65% (87 runs sampled)\nlodash.isEqual x 39,826 ops/sec ±1.32% (86 runs sampled)\nnano-equal x 176,023 ops/sec ±0.89% (92 runs sampled)\nshallow-equal-fuzzy x 146,355 ops/sec ±0.64% (89 runs sampled)\n  fastest: fast-deep-equal\n```\n\n`react-fast-compare` and `fast-deep-equal` should be the same speed for these\ntests; any difference is just noise. `react-fast-compare` won't be faster than\n`fast-deep-equal`, because it's based on it.\n\n### React and Generic Data\n\n```\nreact-fast-compare x 86,392 ops/sec ±0.70% (93 runs sampled)\nfast-deep-equal x 85,567 ops/sec ±0.95% (92 runs sampled)\nlodash.isEqual x 7,369 ops/sec ±1.78% (84 runs sampled)\n  fastest: react-fast-compare,fast-deep-equal\n```\n\nTwo of these packages cannot handle comparing React elements, because they\ncontain circular reference: `nano-equal` and `shallow-equal-fuzzy`.\n\n### Running Benchmarks\n\n```sh\n$ yarn install\n$ yarn run benchmark\n```\n\n## Differences between this library and `fast-deep-equal`\n\n`react-fast-compare` is based on `fast-deep-equal`, with some additions:\n\n- `react-fast-compare` has `try`/`catch` guardrails for stack overflows from undetected (non-React) circular references.\n- `react-fast-compare` has a _single_ unified entry point for all uses. No matter what your target application is, `import equal from 'react-fast-compare'` just works. `fast-deep-equal` has multiple entry points for different use cases.\n\nThis version of `react-fast-compare` tracks `fast-deep-equal@3.1.1`.\n\n## Bundle Size\n\nThere are a variety of ways to calculate bundle size for JavaScript code.\nYou can see our size test code in the `compress` script in\n[`package.json`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/blob/master/package.json).\n[Bundlephobia's calculation](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-fast-compare) is slightly higher,\nas they [do not mangle during minification](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats/blob/v6.1.1/src/getDependencySizeTree.js#L139).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/blob/readme/LICENSE)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see our [contributions guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Maintenance Status\n\n**Active:** Formidable is actively working on this project, and we expect to continue for work for the foreseeable future. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are welcome.\n\n[actions_img]: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n[actions_site]: https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-fast-compare/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n[cov_img]: https://codecov.io/gh/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n[cov_site]: https://codecov.io/gh/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare\n[npm_img]: https://badge.fury.io/js/react-fast-compare.svg\n[npm_site]: http://badge.fury.io/js/react-fast-compare\n[appveyor_img]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/formidablelabs/react-fast-compare?branch=master&svg=true\n[appveyor_site]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare\n[bundle_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/minzipped%20size-656%20B-flatgreen.svg\n[downloads_img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-fast-compare.svg\n[maintenance_img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-active-flatgreen.svg\n",
