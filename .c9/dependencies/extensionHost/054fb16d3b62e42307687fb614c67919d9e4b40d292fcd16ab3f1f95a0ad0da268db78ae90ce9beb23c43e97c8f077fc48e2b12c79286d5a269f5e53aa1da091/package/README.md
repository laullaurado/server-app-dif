## Overview of changes made by AWS Cloud9

- Moved build into c9-build to avoid conflicts with brazil build system
- Removed unnecessary dependencies from package.json (and build/package.json)
- Added our own build scripts for packaging built-in extensions (git)
- Updated tsconfig to export type declarations during build (for easier integration with Public)
- Disable vscode nls module (localization)
- Added our own remote-agent module - it's a bootstrap code that starts the host process
- Exported some private fields from vscode MainThreadSCM and menusExtensionPoint modules (to use them on the client-side)
- Disabled extHostTerminalService to avoid using native dependencies which we can't build
- Changed extHostProcessSetup to account for all the differences in host bootstrap logic

### Procedure for upgrading VS Code fork:

- Choose a release to upgrade from this page: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/releases, and take only the most stable release for it, which is major.minor.MAX or the latest "Recovery", so if we wanna upgrade to 1.40, we would actually upgrade to 1.40.2
- Add `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.git` as a git remote, merge new changes from the version into `mainline`:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.git
git fetch upstream
git merge <major.minor.MAX> // for example git merge 1.40.2
```

- If there are new dependencies, make sure that we need them. If we don't, move them to `ignoredDependencies`.
- Build and test locally, apply changes if necessary.
- Create a CR with only changes to Public (https://code.amazon.com/packages/AWSCloud9Public/trees/mainline)
- After the above CR is approved, add the changes from this fork too at which point the CR becomes unopenable
- There is a chance that our internal npm index would not have some dependencies and the build will fail. In this case request a merge with live VS. If it doesn't help, downgrade vscode.
- Block it on Alpha and do a bug bash trying out the VS Code fork features in Cloud9, which currently means following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/toolkit-welcome.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/source-control-gitpanel.html

## The Repository

This repository ("`Code - OSS`") is where we (Microsoft) develop the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

- For [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
     - If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Remote - Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.
- For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
